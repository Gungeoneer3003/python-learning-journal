# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

I am a third-year Math and Computer Science student at West Valley College (Technically 5th year since I was dual-enrolled in High School)
I know C++ (including DS), Java, Python, R, and I'm very familiar with google sheets formulas 
My goal is to learn more about python and programming in general beyond my experience thus far.

```
print("Hello there!")
s = "General Kenobi! You are a bold one"
for i in range(0, len(s), 5):
  print(s[i:i + 5])
```
